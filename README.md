A collection of custom mGear Shifter components used by Rigmarole Studio

This is meant for use in mGear, the Maya rigging framework.

For more information, you can read this thread on the mGear forums:
http://forum.mgear-framework.com/t/sharing-4-custom-shifter-components/1571

To install and use these:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Put the files somewhere on your computer. Example: /production/mgear/custom/
3. In your Maya.env file, add the following line. Point it to your own directory.

`MGEAR_SHIFTER_CUSTOMSTEP_PATH = /production/mgear/custom/`

4. Restart Maya. In Maya, they should show up in the list with all the other standard Shifter components.

(Animators do not need to install these. Only the rigging team who is building the rigs will need to install them.)
